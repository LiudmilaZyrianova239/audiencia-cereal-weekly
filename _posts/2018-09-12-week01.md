First edit to *OpenStreetMap*:

For my first contribution, I updated information to local public libraries by adding telephone numbers and the library website.

I also corrected the node to point to the correct location of a local church. I updated contact information as well as hours of service for English and Spanish audiences.

I removed an incorrect node marking a street as the location of a railroad crossing.

I added my first new building to the map: a bank that has been in service for a while but wasn't included in *OpenStreetMap*. I took it upon myself to add the building and include its address and company.

I was very impresssed with the editing software *OpenStreetMap* provided. There are a plethora of tools to identify buildings and roads that allow for users to provide accurate information. I found it very easy and intuitive to use.

I was particularly impressed with the amount of accurate information that users have contributed to my local area. A large amount of detail consists of retail space, roadways, and important public ammenities such as the train station, hospital and fire department.

From contributing to *OpenStreetMap* I got the impression that it could serve as a great alternative to the other mapping services, all without selling advertisements and potentially intruding into its users private information. This was a very positive experience.
