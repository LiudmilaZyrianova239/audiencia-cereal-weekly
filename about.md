I am a second-degree student at **Hunter College, City University of New York**.
I am currently enrolled in an independent-study course on the development of and contribution to
Open Source projects, led by Professor Stewart Weiss.


This blog will be periodically updated with my experiences and challenges as I take my first steps
into the Open Source movement.
